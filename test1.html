<h2 class=abstract>Abstract</h2>
<p class=index><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> is an innovation like no other. It is, in theory, the idea of forming computer systems capable of performing tasks that before only a human could comprehend, process and complete. These intelligent computers will be able to conduct their own problem solving and even have the capability to learn how to solve no problems. This innovation will allow for problem-solving like never before where AI will able to detect and process trends in data and information that humans would never be able to find. This allows for the solving of complex problems on a scale not yet imagined. Artificial Intelligence encompasses the idea of Machine learning which is the idea that computers can learn from the data inputted from them, detect patterns and make a decision based on those patterns without the input of humans. While AI may not yet be quite at the level of intelligent, self-learning non-sentient being status it is still used widely today. Examples of AI are <i>Amazon's Alexa</i>, <i>Apple's Siri</i> and <i>IBM Watson</i>. These current AI's already offer a brief glimpse into the enormous possibilities of AI and how it will change the way humans use and process information. AI will have the capability to collect any information and make decisions based off of information making it much easier and faster for humans to solve real problems; and solving problems on a scale once unimaginable. With the assistance of AI humans will be able to process information and complete tasks that before were not possible forever changing the way information is collected, processed and used.</p>
